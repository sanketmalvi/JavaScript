# JavaScript and Classes

Does JS has classes?

Yes, JS have classes. This feature was introduced with the ES6. However, JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritence mechanism. In other words, it provides more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages as java or c++, but under the hood, it works somewhat differently.
